> Agents still write the code. Synapse gives them current team context **before** they edit, then records contract-level changes **after** they edit, so other agents can avoid collisions.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ and npm. Python 3.10+ and Go 1.22+ are optional — needed only to analyze `.py` / `.go` files; without them, those languages degrade gracefully to file-level detection.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

**Seamless multi-machine setup** — two machines coordinate when their daemons share the same `repoId` (auto-derived from the git remote) against the same server.

```bash
# Host: start the server, expose it over a public wss:// tunnel,
# write the URL into .synapse/team.json, and print the teammate command + token.
synapse up --serve --tunnel

# Teammate: commit .synapse/team.json, share the token out-of-band, then:
SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> synapse up
```

`synapse doctor` diagnoses a setup without starting anything (resolved identity, server reachability, auth vs. unreachable, protocol version, live peers).

---

## Try it: see a conflict (two-agent demo)

The fastest way to watch Synapse work. Start with the local dry-run (one machine, no teammate, no Claude needed), then do the real two-machine run.

### Local dry-run — two agents, one machine

Two daemons against one local server, driven by the CLI. Proves the whole detect loop.

```bash
# 1. A throwaway project with a symbol to fight over
mkdir -p /tmp/synapse-demo/src && cd /tmp/synapse-demo && git init -q
printf 'export function area(w: number, h: number): number {\n  return w * h;\n}\n' > src/widget.ts
git add -A && git -c user.email=demo@local -c user.name=demo commit -qm init

# 2. Terminal 1 — server + Alice's daemon
synapse up --serve --member alice --session alice --port 4011 --repo-id demo/playground

# 3. Terminal 2 — Bob's daemon against the same server
synapse daemon --member bob --session bob --port 4012 --server ws://localhost:4010 --repo-id demo/playground

# 4. Terminal 3 — Alice records a change, Bob checks the same symbol first
synapse report --port 4011 --file src/widget.ts --symbol ts:src/widget.ts#area --summary "area() now takes a Rect"
synapse check  --port 4012 --file src/widget.ts --symbol ts:src/widget.ts#area
#  → verdict: "warn", rule: "same_symbol_unpushed", counterpart: "alice"
synapse whatsup --port 4012
```

### Two machines, with Claude Code

Use the Quick Start above to bring up the host (`synapse up --serve --tunnel`) and teammate (`SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN=<token> synapse up`). Then **restart Claude Code** in the repo, confirm the room with `synapse doctor` (it should list the other person as a peer), and drive it **in order**:

- **Alice** asks her Claude: *"Edit `src/auth/token.ts` so `validate` returns `Token | null`."* Let it **save** — the PostToolUse hook reports the delta.
- **Bob** asks his Claude: *"Edit `src/auth/token.ts` so `validate` returns `Promise<boolean>`."* Before it writes, Bob's PreToolUse hook surfaces *"⚠ Synapse: alice has an unpushed change to `validate` — coordinate before editing,"* and Claude asks Bob how to proceed.

### Gotchas (why a demo can look like nothing happened)

1. **Share a real token.** `--tunnel` requires auth; without `SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN` a random token is generated and printed only once. Pass your own so the teammate can join. `synapse doctor` shows `token=unset → 401` when this is wrong.
2. **Different sessions only.** A session never warns about its *own* change — editing twice from one machine/session shows nothing.
3. **Order matters.** The editor must **save first** (PostToolUse reports) before the other agent's PreToolUse check can see it.
4. **Restart Claude Code** after `synapse up` so it loads the freshly installed hooks. Don't commit `.claude/settings.json` — the hook path is machine-specific; each person's `synapse up` writes their own.

---

## Works with any agent, not just Claude Code

Claude Code gets `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `SessionStart` hooks that fire `synapse_check` before edits, `synapse_report` after edits, and a `synapse_whatsup` catch-up at session start. A file-based pre-check records the current contract snapshot locally, so the first post-edit report can emit the real before -> after delta without requiring a separate baseline call. Every other agent gets the **same behavior** through MCP — `synapse join` (and `synapse connect`) sets it up automatically:

```bash
synapse connect                        # wire up every supported agent
synapse connect --agent cursor,vscode  # or just the ones you use
```

This does two things so other agents connect seamlessly and then use Synapse the way it's intended:

1. **Registers the stdio MCP server** in each client's own config — `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, and the cross-agent `.mcp.json` — pointing at `synapse mcp`. The adapter resolves its room (repoId, session, daemon port) from `.synapse/config.json`, so there is nothing else to configure.
2. **Drops rules files that encode the hooks as instructions** — `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules/synapse.mdc`, and `.windsurf/rules/synapse.md` — telling the agent to call `synapse_check` before editing, `synapse_report` after, and `synapse_whatsup` at the start. The MCP server also advertises the same guidance via the protocol-native `instructions` field, so even clients that ignore rules files still receive it.

Every write is idempotent and preserves your existing content (managed blocks for markdown, key-merge for JSON), so it is safe to re-run.

## Architecture

```text
apps/
  cli/          local daemon, CLI commands, and MCP stdio adapter
  server/       websocket fanout server + durable StateStore (SQLite)
packages/
  analyzer-ts/      TypeScript contract extraction
  analyzer-py/      Python contract extraction + dependency graph
  analyzer-go/      Go contract extraction + dependency graph (go/parser sidecar)
                    (tree-sitter + jedi sidecar over JSON-RPC/stdio)
  protocol/         shared wire, state, and symbol types
  conflict-engine/  pure conflict evaluator
```

The server is single-process with an in-memory hot path backed by a durable store. The daemon keeps raw code local. Detection is deterministic; humans decide — Synapse warns inline, never auto-blocks.

---

## Deterministic vs. optional LLM (OpenRouter)

| Layer | Without a key | With `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detection | Fully deterministic | Unchanged (never affected) |
| Analysis | Structured before→after verdict | Task-aware prose; can raise but not downgrade a verdict |
| Resolution | `contract_divergent` → escalate; `same_symbol_unpushed` → adopt counterpart | Synthesizes one merged contract (must parse via the real analyzer) |
| Session summary | Structured list of changes | 2–3 prose sentences |

Set the key in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Model defaults to `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`, overridable via `SYNAPSE_LLM_MODEL`. Disable layers independently with `SYNAPSE_LLM_EXPLAIN=0`, `SYNAPSE_LLM_RESOLVE=0`, `SYNAPSE_LLM_SUMMARY=0`.

---

## Server auth modes

Resolved at server startup. `/health` and the GitHub webhook (its own HMAC) stay open; credentials are sent via `?token=` / `Authorization: Bearer` and compared in constant time — never written to disk.

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **open** | neither var set | No auth — keeps local/dev and verify scripts hermetic |
| **shared-token** | `SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN` | Any valid token reads/writes any project |
| **project-key** | `SYNAPSE_MASTER_SECRET` | Real tenancy: key = `base64url(HMAC-SHA256(secret, repoId))`, authorizes only its project (checked at handshake + per-message) |

Credentials are sent via `Authorization: Bearer` (the server still accepts `?token=` for back-compat), keeping tokens out of URL query strings and access logs.

**State store** — persisted per entity (sessions, locks, deltas, pushes, events, resolutions, summaries, feedback as rows; every mutation writes only its own row). Backend selection: `SYNAPSE_DATABASE_URL` → Postgres (the shared-database backend for multi-instance deployments; the `pg` driver loads only when selected); else `SYNAPSE_DB_PATH` → file-backed SQLite (WAL) that survives restarts; neither → ephemeral in-memory SQLite. Pre-existing SQLite snapshot databases migrate to per-entity rows automatically on first boot. Postgres schema initialization is serialized with advisory locks, and startup always attempts to release the lock before returning the pooled connection, including when DDL fails.

**Multi-instance** — set `SYNAPSE_REDIS_URL` (alongside a shared `SYNAPSE_DATABASE_URL`) to run several server instances behind a load balancer: after a mutation, the instance publishes the repo's Redis channel; the others re-read that repo from the shared store and re-broadcast the fresh snapshot to their local rooms. Redis carries no state — it is purely the wake-up signal (the `redis` driver loads only when selected), and lock/session expiry stays timestamp-based against the shared rows, so every instance evaluates the same liveness. Unset → the single-instance path, unchanged.

---

## Reliability & operations

| Capability | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| **Resilient channel** | Exponential backoff + full jitter (`SYNAPSE_RECONNECT_BASE_MS` / `SYNAPSE_RECONNECT_MAX_MS`), capped offline outbox flushed in order on reconnect, and 20s server pings (`SYNAPSE_WS_PING_INTERVAL_MS`) that terminate half-open sockets |
| **Observability** | JSON logs gated by `SYNAPSE_LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`) + Prometheus counters at `GET /metrics` |
| **Ingress validation** | Every server-bound wire message is validated against shared zod schemas before any state mutation, and daemon-bound server frames are validated before they update the warm cache. WS/webhook bodies and local daemon JSON tool bodies are capped at 1MB; malformed local JSON returns 400 and oversized local JSON returns 413 |
| **Rate limiting** | Per-connection WS budget (`SYNAPSE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`, default 600) and a webhook budget (`SYNAPSE_WEBHOOK_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`, default 120): over-limit messages are acked `rate_limited` and dropped before any mutation; webhooks answer 429. `0` disables |
| **Webhook posture** | A server running with auth (shared token or project keys) refuses unsigned webhooks with 403 until `SYNAPSE_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set; open mode (local/dev) is unchanged |
| **Protocol negotiation** | Versions are exchanged at the WS handshake: legacy clients (no announcement) connect as v1, newer clients downgrade to the server's dialect, out-of-range clients are refused with HTTP 426 + the supported range in headers. `/health` reports `protocolVersion` + `minProtocolVersion`; `synapse doctor` fails loudly on non-overlapping ranges |
| **Adaptive severity** | `synapse_feedback` telemetry demotes a noisy rule (≥5 dismissals, ≥80% dismiss rate) from `warn` to `info`; detection never changes. Opt out with `SYNAPSE_ADAPTIVE_SEVERITY=0` |
| **Branch-aware severity** | Cross-branch `dependency_changed`/`stale_base` conflicts demote `warn` → `info` (they bite at merge time, not on the next keystroke); merge-blocking rules (`same_symbol_*`, `contract_divergent`) never demote. Sessions/pushes carry their git branch (webhook pushes derive it from `ref`), refreshed on every heartbeat so a mid-session checkout propagates within ~30s; unknown branch → no change. Opt out with `SYNAPSE_BRANCH_AWARE_SEVERITY=0` |
| **File watcher** | The daemon watches the worktree (same ignore set as the analyzer scan), so manual edits — no agent, no `synapse_report` — still emit contract deltas through the report path. Debounced per file (`SYNAPSE_WATCH_DEBOUNCE_MS`, default 400ms); only analyzable sources are reported. While the watcher is active, warm pre-edit checks reuse the cached dependency graph instead of re-scanning the source tree (any report or watched change invalidates it; `synapse_graph_cache_hits_total` counts reuse). Opt out with `SYNAPSE_FILE_WATCHER=0` |

**RAG memory** — with `SYNAPSE_DATABASE_URL` (Postgres + pgvector) and an OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint (`SYNAPSE_EMBED_BASE_URL`), the server indexes session summaries, contract resolutions, and repo events as vectors, and `synapse_why` answers **hybrid**: the deterministic lexical floor always stands, vector recall only adds semantically-related memories on top (`rag: true`, numbered citations preserved). pgvector extension/table initialization uses the same advisory-lock discipline as the state store and degrades cleanly if setup fails. Without embeddings, `/recall` reports `degraded: true` and the floor answers alone. Only prose is embedded — titles, summaries, rationales — never raw code. `SYNAPSE_RAG=0` disables.

**Privacy** — detection is fully deterministic and local: only symbol-level contracts (signatures, never function bodies) leave the daemon. The optional LLM layers relax this in one place: the contract *resolver* sends the computing agent's full file plus its dependency-graph neighbors to the configured model so the merge is caller-aware. Opt out with `SYNAPSE_LLM_RESOLVE=0` (or leave `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` unset), or point `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` at a local/self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint to keep code on your machines.

**Install as a package** — the CLI ships as a single self-contained npm package (all five workspace packages, the server, and the Python/Go sidecar assets bundled):

```bash
npm install -g @kumario/synapse   # installs the `synapse` binary
```

To build the same tarball from a checkout (release flow):

```bash
node scripts/build-package.mjs    # stages + packs dist-release/<name>-<version>.tgz
npm run verify:package            # installs from the tarball and smoke-tests it
npm publish --access public dist-release/<tarball>   # maintainers only
```

The public name/version live in [`release.config.json`](release.config.json); bump the version there before building, and keep it ahead of `npm view @kumario/synapse version`.

**CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs build + typecheck + test plus the full hermetic verify matrix:

```bash
npm run verify:all                                       # one build, then every verify
node scripts/ci-verify-all.mjs --only why,doctor         # a subset while iterating
SYNAPSE_VERIFY_SKIP=hot-path-latency npm run verify:all  # explicit skips
```

## Verification scripts

Run with `npm run <script>`. See [`package.json`](package.json) for the complete list.

| Script | Verifies |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:m0` | Runnable skeleton + realtime stub loop (milestone 0) |
| `verify:analyzer-ts` / `verify:analyzer-py` | Per-language contract extraction, signature diffing, and TS import-edge coverage |
| `verify:python-check` | Full realtime Python loop → `contract_divergent` + resolution |
| `verify:analyzer-go` / `verify:go-check` | Go contract extraction/diff (warm `go/parser` sidecar); full realtime Go loop → `contract_divergent` + resolution. SKIPs without a Go toolchain |
| `verify:daemon-ts-report` / `verify:file-only-ts-check` | Automatic TS report path; symbol-level conflicts from a file path |
| `verify:dependency-ts-check` | Warns when a file depends on another's unpushed change through TS dependency edges |
| `verify:tsx-check` | React-shaped repos: default-exported `.tsx` component props change → symbol delta + `dependency_changed` for the importing component; `.mjs` modules join the same graph |
| `verify:contract-compat` / `verify:resolution` | Compatibility classification; merged-contract resolution |
| `verify:hot-path-latency` / `verify:large-repo-latency` / `verify:repo-latency` | Pre-edit hot-path latency budgets (p95 ≤ 50ms, max ≤ 150ms) |
| `verify:whatsup` / `verify:why` / `verify:feedback` | Team briefing; memory search; conflict feedback telemetry |
| `verify:session-summary` / `verify:session-start` | Layer II session summaries and catch-up briefing |
| `verify:hooks` | Claude Code `join` + `hook pre`/`hook post` as invoked by Claude Code, including check-before-edit then first post-edit delta reporting |
| `verify:mcp-adapter` | Stdio MCP adapter forwarding to the daemon |
| `verify:connect` | `synapse connect` wires up every agent (configs + rules), idempotently, and the MCP server advertises hook-equivalent `instructions` |
| `verify:auth` / `verify:tenancy` | Shared-token and project-key auth paths |
| `verify:up` / `verify:up-tunnel` / `verify:doctor` | Multi-machine setup, tunnels, and preflight diagnostics |
| `verify:persistence` | State survives a server restart (SQLite, per-entity rows) |
| `verify:persistence-pg` | Same durability proof on Postgres incl. advisory-locked schema init and SIGKILL; runs when `SYNAPSE_VERIFY_PG_URL`/`SYNAPSE_DATABASE_URL` is set (CI service), SKIPs offline |
| `verify:multi-instance` | Two servers on shared Postgres + Redis, daemons split across them; a report on A is readable in `GET /state` on B and pushed to B's daemon. Needs `SYNAPSE_VERIFY_PG_URL` + `SYNAPSE_VERIFY_REDIS_URL` (CI services), SKIPs offline |
| `verify:file-watcher` | A manual edit (no report call) emits a contract delta via the watcher; non-analyzable files ignored; `SYNAPSE_FILE_WATCHER=0` daemon stays inert |
| `verify:reconnect` | A delta emitted while the server is down still reaches the team after restart |
| `verify:metrics` | Structured logs and `/metrics` counters |
| `verify:protocol-compat` | Handshake version negotiation: legacy accepted, newer downgraded, out-of-range refused with 426 + range headers |
| `verify:security` | WS flood → `rate_limited` acks, state bounded; local daemon JSON 413/400 regressions; webhook 429 past budget; auth-mode server refuses unsigned webhooks (403) until a secret is set, then signed-only |
| `verify:fuzz` | Seeded malformed-source corpus against all three analyzers: the TS extractor never throws; the Python/Go sidecars answer or reject every request and stay healthy |
| `verify:why-rag` | Hybrid recall: a question with zero lexical overlap finds the memory through vectors (stub embeddings, advisory-locked pgvector init); the lexical floor alone finds nothing; no provider → `degraded: true`. Needs pgvector (CI image), SKIPs offline |
| `verify:adaptive-severity` | Feedback-tuned demotion of noisy warnings |
| `verify:branch-aware-severity` | Cross-branch `stale_base`/`dependency_changed` demote to `info`; merge-blocking rules and same-branch conflicts still warn |
| `verify:docker` | Builds the server image, boots it, drives one edit→report |
| `verify:npm-pack` | Packs the CLI, installs into a fresh project, joins, drives a check |
| `verify:github-webhook` / `verify:github-briefing` | GitHub push/PR/review/comment webhooks and catch-ups |
| `verify:all` | One build, then every verify (the CI matrix) |
| `eval:conflicts` | Recorded conflict eval suite (overlap, breaking, compatible, divergent, …) |
